# Computational-biology
Computational biology note based on Wageningen University&Research's class. Course code:SSB34306
This is a course note writed by Zhiyi. While retaining the framework of the lectures and assignment content, some of the content of interest has been organized here.

# Skills that need to be mastered in advance
This course uses Jupyter for assignments, which uses two common cell types:
Code Cells: Used to write Python code, which generates output when run.
Markdown Cells: Used to write captions, formulas, images, tables, and more. It supports Markdown syntax and can directly render LaTeX mathematical formulas.

## Python
This lesson will only use simple Python code to perform formula calculations. If you don't want to learn, you can also do the calculations manually.

## Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write documents in a plain text format that's easy to read and write. It also supports inserting rich web links and highlighting code blocks and their associated language.

## LaTeX
You can use LaTeX to write formulas in your daily homework, or you can use LaTeX to complete beautiful course papers.

# 1A Molecular biology primer: from gene to protein
## Lecture
- Central dogma\
[Central dogma](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Central-Dogma). The central dogma of molecular biology is a theory stating that genetic information flows only in one direction, from DNA, to RNA, to protein, or RNA directly to protein. Now its already expand like the picture below.

Protein is more abundant in creatures, people also first sequenced protein by Edmann degradation method. But now, DNA sequence is becoming cheaper and cheaper, the data for DNA sequence is also increasing in a fast way.

The [DNA sequencing method](https://www.geneious.com/guides/introduction-to-dna-sequencing), we will learn how to analyze sequencing data in the coming course, but its also recommended to learn where the data come from.\

- Genome\
In classical genetics, the genome of a diploid organism refers to a full set of chromosomes or genes in a gamete. A regular somatic cell contains two full sets of genomes(and a mitochondrial genome)\
In haploid organisms, including bacteria, archaea and viruses, a cell contains only a single set of the genome, usually in a single circular or contiguous linear DNA.\
Mitochondrial and Chloroplast genome are also present in single copy.\
Size of the genomes is variable and does not correlate with complexity of living beings. And small and simple does not mean harmless.

- Gene
